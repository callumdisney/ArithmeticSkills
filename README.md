# ArithmeticSkills

## Why?
I originally started this for an "Algorithms Challenge" in my Computer Science class, but I never finished it in class, and then I was like "I really want this to work" so I made it work and now it works and here is the code.

The original challenge was "Challenge 39: A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask student’s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10. Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz. Write an algorithm for the process described above."

So I did it.

## What else can it do?
I added various features not included in the original challenge question, such as:
* Choosing how many questions there are
* Choosing which numbers the questions should contain (i.e. numbers between 5 and 10)
* The division operator
* Storing the results in a log file (there is [an example of the log file](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/results.txt) included in this repository)

## Versions?
The main code is located at [main.py](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/main.py). There is a version wihtout the division operator, which can make for some nasty questions, located at [withoutDiv.py](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/withoutDiv.py).

## More?
Perhaps I will add more at some point. Perhaps not. We'll see.
