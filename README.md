# ArithmeticSkills

## Why?
I originally started this for an "Algorithms Challenge" in my Computer Science class, but I never finished it in class, and then I was like "I really want this to work" so I made it work and now it works and here is the code.

The original challenge was "Challenge 39: A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask studentâ€™s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10. Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz. Write an algorithm for the process described above."

It can be seen [on the OCR website](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/599395-40-algorithm-challenges-booklet.docx).

## What else can it do?
I added various features not included in the original challenge question, such as:
* Choosing how many questions there are
* Choosing which numbers the questions should contain (i.e. numbers between 5 and 10)
* The division operator
* Storing the results in a log file (there is [an example of the log file](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/results.txt) included in this repository)

## Versions?
The main code is located at [main.py](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/main.py). There is a version wihtout the division operator located at [withoutDiv.py](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/withoutDiv.py), as the division operator can make for some nasty questions. 

## More?
Perhaps I will add more at some point. Perhaps not. We'll see.
